## The problem

Data lakehouses or warehouses often have a proliferation of tables, many containing similar data.
Column names in these tables are not always clear and not documented.
For most users, it's not clear which table they should be querying to get information.

To solve this problem, we want to enable the user to ask questions about the schema via an LLM.
The LLM can suggest example queries, or query the data source directly itself to gain more information.
